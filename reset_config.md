# Resetting the configuration

This is done by deleting the configuration file called settings.cfg. This will force the game to use the predefined defaults within the executables.

## Windows

Double click on the config_directory.bat. This will take you to the directory where the config-file is stored. Delete the settings.cfg file.

## Linux/\*nix

The config-file is stored at `~/.teeworlds/settings.cfg`. Just run this command from a terminal to delete it.

`# rm ~/.teeworlds/settings.cfg`

## OSX

Delete `settings.cfg` in `~/Library/Application Support/Teeworlds`.
